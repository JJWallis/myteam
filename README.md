## Overview

### The challenge

Your users should be able to:

-  View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
-  See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
-  See the correct content for each team member on the About page when the + icon is clicked
-  Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
-  The Name, Email Address or Message fields are empty should show "This field is required"
-  The Email Address is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"

## My process

### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  Mobile-first workflow
-  Flexbox
-  CSS Grid
-  Sass
-  Typescript

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
   color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
   console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

Development process - building design system 1st vs writing HTML 1st (have classes to apply)

Img handling -

SVG animation -

Sass maps - for out-putting CSS rules (vs hard-coding)

Accessibility - write more semantic HTML (better wrappers, multiple headers + footers, headings where appropaite)

### Useful resources

-  [Build a space travel website with Kevin Powell](https://scrimba.com/learn/spacetravel) - As this way my first multi-page project of this scale, I wanted to adopt a methodology that allowed me to work efficiently when tackling such a large task. Kevin is an amazing teacher who I learn from every time I watch him, forever a valueable resource!

-  [Modular CSS with Sass Course](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/modular-css-with-sass) - Treehouse is an immense resource of great information from long-time developers. Although some of it can be outdated, the theoretical knowledge you gain of how the tech works behind the scenes way outweighs that small issue.

-  [Kevin Powell - most common HTML mistakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NexL5_Vdoq8&ab_channel=KevinPowell) - This video was a great resource in showing me how to properly structure a HTML page in the most semantic manner, focusing on not overusing headings and instead styling additional context about sections of content like headings if that style is desired.

###### TODO

HTML:

CSS:

JS:

Design system - utility classes pre HTML | components + how to re-use as much as poss (1st with ultilities after)

Accessibility - aria-selected

specific selectors to re-use active class + keep JS code more DRY

Sass TH features - organised map vs hardcoding css vars + utility classes | placeholders vs utility classes

CSS vars vs Sass vars - overriding | alpha channel | canâ€™t override Sass variables directly (have to declare multiple versions of them)

Accessibility - form (aria-label + legend + labels - with .sr-only class)

Tablet design provided - opened our eyes to design possibilityes + ways of filling space | not just enlarging font + trying to fit it all barely in until major change happens for medium screens (flex-row)

Tetsing, Testing, testing, testing

Testing, testing, testing

Kevin Notes:

Classes on <body> for other pages too?
